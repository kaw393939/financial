# Project docs (for students)

This repo is a small but complete example of **spec-driven development** + **agentic orchestration** + **test-driven delivery**:

- Spec: start with a written spec you can point at.
- Sprints: break the spec into small deliverable increments with clear acceptance criteria.
- Tests: write **positive and negative** tests at the right level (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- Automation: run tests in CI and deploy a real artifact.
